Tic-Tac-Toe Web application

To create a tic-tac-toe web app, I'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll write functions to handle user clicks, keep track of the game state, and check for winning conditions. This will make the game interactive, allowing users to play against each other or against the computer. The goal is to get three markers in a row to win. I'm excited to build this project and improve my web development skills!
